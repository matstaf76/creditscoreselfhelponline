        <h2>Get a Good Copy of Your Credit Report</h2>
            <p>This is the government's website to get a free credit report once a year. It is <a href= "https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action">AnnualCreditReport.com</a></p>
            <p>That is not necessarily the best copy of your credit report.</p>
            <p>NOT ALL CREDIT REPORTS ARE CREATED EQUAL.</p>
            <p>The best copy you can get of your credit report is from a Tri-merge Credit Report. You can only get these from mortgage companies and the credit vendors that deal with them. Unfortunately they do not sell these to consumers. The copies produced for the purpose of real estate loans are more comprehensive than any other copies and will have the most information in your file. Copies produced for auto-loans don't have as much information, credit cards even less, and utilities even less all the way down to your free copy.</p>
            <p>Despite what is supposed to happen under the law in reality you get what you paid for. If there is not much in your credit file it may be the same across the board but it may not be. You should be as thorough as possible and get the best copy you can.</p>
