            <p>There are many tools necessary to fix your credit and finances</p>
            <h1>The Letters</h1>
            <P>These are the main tools. Anything sent through the United States Postal Service is considered true in a court of law. That is why the penalties for mail fraud are so severe.</P>
            <p>This means when negotiating with any company it is highly beneficial for you to do so in writing through the United States Postal Service.</p>

            <p>Do not write anything you specifically know to be untrue because that could be considerd fraud and is unnecessary.</p>
