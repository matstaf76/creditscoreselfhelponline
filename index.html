            <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">There are affiliate links on this website. I get paid if you use their offers. They are here because I did a small amount of research and I think some people might want to utilize these services. I do not know if they are perfect for you and your goals. You must do your own research for what makes sense for you, especially with financial products of anykind</p>
            <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">If you have a bad experience with them you must deal with them, I do not work for them and I can provide no customer service. However, let me know and they will not be on this website if they cause people problems.</p>
