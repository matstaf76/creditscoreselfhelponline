    <p>In fact, if you have no derogatory accounts <a href="I_have_no_credit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a> this is your only step.</p>
                
    <p>If you have revolving credit accounts that have reported high balances call the customer service numbers and try to get a CREDIT LIMIT INCREASE.</p>
    <P>If they agree to it ask them to send you a letter indicating your new credit limit.</P>
    <p>Increasing your credit limit will reduce your <p><span class="bold-and-large"><a href="credit_utilization_ratio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Credit Utilization Ratio.</a></span><br></p>
    <p>This action alone will likely increase your credit score significantly.</p>

    <h2>If you don't have any open revolving accounts, apply for a new secured credit card.</h2>
    <p>A secured credit card is issued based on a deposit you pay. It doesn't matter how bad or nonexistent your credit is, with a deposit they will issue you a card. Your credit limit is equal to your deposit minus any fees to start the account. I cannot recommend one card over another. There is no perfect credit card company. There are no saints in this business. To fix and maintain your credit report, credit cards are a necessary evil. To rent a car these days they are a necessary evil. If you need to go this route always make sure the card you select is reported to the credit bureaus monthly.</p>

    <!-- Add the rest of your letter content here -->

    <p>I have done a small amount of research on the companies in the link below. The reason they are on this website is because they report your payments to the bureaus every month. This will give you a credit history with that card. Every one of these companies have their own offers and TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>

    <h2>YOU MUST DO SOME RESEARCH</h2> 
    <p>Find secured credit cards that have terms and conditions you can live with. Again do not use them a great deal. AVOID charging over 50% of your credit limit or it will damage your credit score. The only reason you are going to have these accounts is to get yourself good credit. If some catastrophe occurs you have them for that but DO NOT GO SHOPPING WITH THEM. Leave them in a drawer at home.</p>
    <p>After 3 to 6 months of good payment history apply for an UNSECURED CREDIT CARD.</p>
    <p>The reason you want at least two <a href="types_of_credit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REVOLVING CREDIT ACCOUNTS</a> in your credit report is because certain types of mortgages and real estate loans require you to have at least 2 seasoned accounts in your credit file to qualify for certain products like an FHA Loan. A SEASONED account is at least 24 months old.</p>
