            <h2>Send Letters to the Companies in Your Credit Report</h2>

<p>First, send a letter demanding for debt validation to every one of the negative accounts that are closed or if you don't recognize the company.</p>
<p>All of the collection agencies and charged off accounts should be sent a debt validation letter. A debt validation letter is when you exercise your rights and ask these creditors to prove that these accounts are yours and that the company reporting in your credit report has done things correctly to the letter of the law.</p>
<p>You should also mention in the letter that you require them to only deal with you through the United States Postal Service and any phone calls will not be accepted and will be considered harassment.</p>
<p>Send a Debt Validation Letter directly to every company reporting a negative account.</p>
<p>When sending these companies these letters go into the post office and send the letters to the creditor by regular mail BUT get a receipt from the post office for the postage paid. Do not just attach stamps to them. You need the receipt to send to the credit bureaus proving the day you sent the letters. It is important.</p>
<p>The time clock on how long they have to prove their claims against you has just began and you need proof sent through the US Postal Service.</p>
<p>It has been my experience over and over again that these companies will most likely ignore your letters except they increase their efforts to collect. Don't worry about it. If they call you tell them you have sent them a letter demanding debt validation and not to call you again.</p>
<p>Do not answer any of their questions and do not verify any information for them.</p>
<p>DO NOT VERIFY YOUR ADDRESS OR NAME. JUST HANG UP.</p>
<p>You are not being rude, they are being predatory</p>
<p>Do your best to keep records of when they call you or any information they send back to you. You may need it to strengthen a lawsuit against them for violating your rights and for harassment.</p>

<p>For any companies in your credit report that are still open and you use them but they have reported late payments, you are going to send a different letter. This letter should state that you have no records indicating you had paid the account more than 30 days late and you would like them to check their records. Also under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act they were supposed to send you a written notice five days prior to the insertion of negative information in your credit report. Ask them for proof that they have sent that and request a copy of that notice.</p>
